This repo was going to be yet-another Bitcoin service implementaion (like bitcoin-central, Mt Gox, MyBitcoin...)

But "account hub" is too generic a name for a specific implementation.

So instead, this repo will contain wiki pages and integration code to help the world's clients and servers get along.
